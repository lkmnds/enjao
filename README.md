This was a project of an engine in C# for his little game, "Jimmy Meatball"

As of the commentary in line 11 on game.cs, this project is dead by now and I just uploaded the code for him with hope that someone could continue his project.

If you want to work on this project, talk to him on [his github](http://github.com/tevira) or on his [email](mailto:jaolocaodasquebrada@gmail.com)
